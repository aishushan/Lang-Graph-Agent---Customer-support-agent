Smart Decision Making: AI-powered escalation and resolution logic

Knowledge Base Integration: Automated solution retrieval

üìã Workflow Stages
INTAKE - Accept and validate incoming support tickets

UNDERSTAND - Parse requests and extract entities

PREPARE - Normalize, enrich data, and add flags

ASK - Determine if clarification is needed

WAIT - Handle clarification responses

RETRIEVE - Search knowledge base for solutions

DECIDE - Evaluate solutions and make escalation decisions

UPDATE - Update or close tickets based on decisions

CREATE - Generate response drafts

DO - Execute API calls and send notifications

COMPLETE - Output final payload and results
